# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Basics/Must know:

#### Big O Notation: 
Big O notation is a symbolism used to define the asymptotic action of functions in complexity theory, computer science, and mathematics. It essentially shows you how quickly a role expands or declines.

#### Big Ω Omega Notation:
The big Omega() function, which is similar to big O notation, is used in computer science to define an algorithm's output or complexity.

## Difference between Big O and Big Ω
The difference between Big O and Big notation is that Big O is used to characterize an algorithm's worst-case running time. Big notation, on the other hand, is used to define a given algorithm's best case running time.

#### Theta Θ Notation:
The theta notation describes exact asymptotic action by bounding a function from above and below. Dropping low order terms and ignoring leading constants is an easy way to get Theta notation for an expression.

## Big O Notation Order:
#### O(1) – Constant time
#### O(log n) – Logarithmic time
#### O(n) – Linear time
#### O(n log n) – Quasilinear time
#### O(n²) – Quadratic time

## What does these notations mean?

#### O(1):Constant Time

#### O(log n):Logarithmic Time

#### O(n):Linear Time

#### O(n log n):Quasilinear Time

#### O(n²):Quadratic Time

## Data Structures:

### List
A *Linked List* is a linear set of data items called nodes, each of which has a pointer pointing to the next node. It's a data structure made up of a set of nodes that together form a sequence.
