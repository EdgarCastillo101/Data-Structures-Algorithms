# Data Structures & Algorithms
* A *Linked List* is a linear set of data items called nodes, each of which has a pointer pointing to the next node. It's a data structure made up of a set of nodes that together form a sequence.
* * **Singly-connected list**: a linked list with each node pointing to the next node and the last node pointing to null. 
* **Doublely-linked list**: a linked list on which each node has two pointers, p and n, pointing to the previous and next nodes, respectively; the last node's n pointer points to null.
