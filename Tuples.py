# Tuples is an immutable sequence of Python objects and also comparable and hashable.
# immutable == not changeable as arrays.

# Time Complexity: 0(1)
# Space Complexity: 0(n)

# How to create tuples?

newTuple = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
newTuple1 = ('a',) 
# needs comma to be a tuple, without it, 
# it's identified as an element alone.


print(newTuple1)
