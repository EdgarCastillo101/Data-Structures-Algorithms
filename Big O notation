Big O notation
---------------
Big O is the language and metric we use to describe the effiency of algorithms.
It is complexity that is going to be less or equal to the worst case.
Ex: O(N)

Big Ω (Big Omega)
------------------
It is a complexity that is going to be at least more than the best case.
Ex: Ω(1) 

Big Theta (Big Θ)
------------------
It is a complexity that is within bounds of the worst and the best cases.
Ex: Θ(n/2)
